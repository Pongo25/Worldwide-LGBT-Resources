<h2 id="binding">Binding</h2> 

<p>
    Do I need a binder? Binders help relieve chest dysphoria and may flatten a chest slightly to appear more masculine. <br>
</p>

<h3>How to find the right size for your binder?</h3>
<p>
    Most websites have a size guide for their binders, 
    measured with a sewing measuring tape (flexible) around your ribs, 
    and also around your chest itself. 
    Make sure the binder you wear you are able to breathe and move around still. <br>
    Binders brand new come stiff and over time wear down. 
    If you don't want it to shrink, don't put it in the dryer (the heat shrinks it) so hang it to dry instead. 
    If you do want it to, I'd recommend buying a new one instead. Otherwise just be careful with the heat & timing of it. <br>

<h3>How to apply Trans tape Tips & Tricks</h3>
<h4>The preparations and tips</h4> 

<ol>
    <li>
        Make sure you have oil at home. Vegetable oil, sunflower oil or olive oil. No scented or flavored.
    </li>
    <li>
        Cut the strips. Usually the size taken is three blocks. 
        Trans tape has lines on the back, thin ones and a visibly thicker one. 
        Three of the thicker blocks being a single strip. Cut out four of these. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Cut the corners round, just slightly not making them fully round, just not pointed. 
        This makes it less quickly curl up, like bandaids tend to do at the tips. Makes it last longer.
    </li>
    <li>
        Apply the tape. Now, you will get instructions when ordering trans tape, 
        but I really recommend looking up trans tape application tutorials on YouTube 
        and avoiding the one actually done by the transtape company themselves 
        because I've found those are really bad tutorials and show minimal efficiency.
    </li>
    <li>
        When applying, do not lift your arm and don't lean forward. 
        Instead, lean backwards a bit and keep your arm just somewhere in between, 
        just not pulled up or else it will fold the skin when you put your arm down. 
        These wrinkles in the tape are really bad. If you have just a slight one or very small ones it's fine, 
        but if it's visibly more or really big, take it off. It can cause skin damage or worse.
    </li>
    <li>
        When taking it off, use oil. Let it soak for at least 30 min, 
        then take a hot shower or bath and slowly, very slowly peel it off. 
        If it hurts you're going too fast, it doesn't have to hurt. 
        Also the oil helps to rub off the remains of the glue stuff. 
        Use some lotion or skin care afterwards.
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>The actual application</h4>
<p>
    Don'ts I've learned through experience 
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Don't bend forward
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't put your arm up
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't let it wrinkle
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't apply at the nearest show of bump where it seems to go up, 
        apply it where you feel gives the most movement when you put your hand on it and push it to the side. 
        Use your fingertips of four fingers to test where it would go if you push it, 
        because pushing it is also how it is applied and how it is pushed influences the end result 
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't use scented oil, you'll smell like it for three days even with showering and bathing. It's terrible 
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't forget to make nip covers beforehand. 
        Just small square versions the size that just cover it with a bit of toilet paper 
        and balm on it to keep them from drying out under the tape. You'll really not want to skip this
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't forget to buy the oil. Check if you have oil before sticking anything onto your body
    </li>
    <li>
        Don't follow a single tutorial. Watch multiple tutorials, if possible ones that have your body type or size, 
        including the aftercare ones. Do a lot of tutorial watching beforehand, saves a lot of trouble.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
            The rest really just comes down to practice, trial and error, and getting a feel for it. 
            It makes binding breathable and it can be a nice break from a binder, but it can be used long term as well. 
            Since it will show a little bit of a bump afterwards, nothing major just the usual human shape of muscle or fat tissue, 
            but if this makes you uncomfortable you can wear a tough material shirt or top underneath a shirt to have a more flat look. 
            It can be really useful or helpful, really depends per person if they like it or not
