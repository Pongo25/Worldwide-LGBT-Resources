    What is HRT? Hormone replacement therapy is a medication used to help adjust hormones in the body to better reflect gender identity and/or medical needs. <br>
    Anyone can use HRT including transgender, Intersex and even Cis people (folks who are not transgender, and whose gender identity matches their assigned sex at birth). <br>
    <br>
    What are the effects of HRT?<br>
    for Trans men(testosterone) and Trans women(estrogen): <br>
    <a href="https://www.gendergp.com/hrt-timelines-hormones-effects/">https://www.gendergp.com/hrt-timelines-hormones-effects/</a><br>
    FYI-Both Cis & Trans People can have similar effects from hormone levels side effects.<br>
    Ex: both cis and trans men may or may not be impacted by baldness. <br>
    This can be due to family genetics. <br>

    <b>Methods of HRT</b><br>
    <i>
        * see a doctor or licensed medical professional to start HRT and get regular blood work for your health and safety.<br>

    </i> 
</p>
<p>
    <b>HRT for Trans Masc:</b><br>
    <i>* testosterone doesn't need an estrogen blocker or another med with it.</i><br>
    (different than fem transition)<br>
    Injections of Testosterone 1x a week or 2x a month, at home (subq or intramuscular)<br>
    Medication-pills (testosterone)<br>
    Patches on skin (testosterone)-if you are allergic to adhesive this might not be for you<br>
    “Testo-pellets” (testosterone)-in office procedure with numbing<br>
    “Andro-Gel” for testosterone (or gel for estrogen HRT to rub into skin)-risk to spread to other humans and pets in household<br>
    Long Term injections 5x a year called “aveed” (testosterone)-ask your doctor about potential risks (mine made me stay 30 mins after shot in case of rare side effect. I was fine)<br>
    Topical cream for estrogen (atrophy of genitals,not main source)
</p>
<p>
    <b>HRT for Trans Fem:</b><br>
    <i>
        * You need Estrogen higher than Testosterone and an anti-androgen to block T. <br>
        Progesterone might be added to treatment later into HRT journey, ask your doctor if this is right for you.<br>
    </i>
    Medication-pills (estrogen, spironolactone, progesterone)<br>
    anti-androgen alternatives to Spironolactone are Cyproterone Acetate,Bicalutamide. <br>
    Patches on skin(estrogen)if you are allergic to adhesive this might not be for you<br>
    Injections of Estrogen 1x a week or 2x a month, at home (subq or intramuscular)<br>
    Gel for Estrogen ( HRT to rub into skin)-risk of rubbing off onto other humans or pets in household.<br>

    Spray and internal rings might also be an option for main source or add on to your hrt.

    <b>Advice for surgery consults:</b><br>
    Do a lot of research before choosing the surgery and doctor.<br>
    Ask your doctor about:
    <ul>
        <li>
            how far they are booking out. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Pre Surgery preparation for you, your home and anything you'd need to buy/they recommend. <br>
            (needing to quit nicotine, stop any meds, buy a special pillow or binder,etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
            Ask if they have a BMI limit or anything they need to qualify you for surgery (HRT, letters,etc)
        </li>
        <li>
            Ask about post op recovery (how long it is, pain levels,medications,other people helping you,hospital stay,etc)
        </li>
        <li>
            Risk of complications, how often it occurs and if hospital stays are common.
        </li>
        <li>
            For Top surgery ask about dog ears (skin/fat under arms needing liposuction)
        </li>
        <li>
            Nerve damage/loss of feeling (all surgery)
        </li>
        <li>
            Loss of pleasure for bottom surgery
        </li>
        <li>
            How long they've been doing this type of surgery as a surgeon, if any other surgeons are assisting the surgery
        </li>
        <li>
            How long the surgery is day of and how the surgery day will be.
        </li>
        <li>
            Ask about pictures of surgery before and after from that surgeon if they allow you to see them.<br>
            (you can also look online at peoples reviews of that surgeon)
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure your insurance and or payment method will work, talk to your doctor and insurance in depth about this.
