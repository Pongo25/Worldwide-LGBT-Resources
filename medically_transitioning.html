            <u>What is HRT?</u> Hormone replacement therapy is a medication used to help adjust hormones in the body to better reflect gender identity and/or medical needs. <br>
            Anyone can use HRT including transgender, Intersex and even Cis people (folks who are not transgender, and whose gender identity matches their assigned sex at birth). <br>
            <br>
            <u>What are the effects of HRT?</u><br>
            for Trans men(testosterone) and Trans women(estrogen): <br>

            </a><br>
            FYI-Both Cis & Trans People can have similar effects from hormone levels side effects.<br>
            Ex: both cis and trans men may or may not be impacted by baldness. <br>
            This can be due to family genetics. <br>

                    Pre Surgery preparation for you, your home and anything you'd need to buy/they recommend. <br>

                </li>
                <li>
                    Ask if they have a BMI limit or anything they need to qualify you for surgery (HRT, letters,etc)
                </li>
                <li>
