    Raising a transgender kid: More Coming soon.
    <ol>
        <li>
            The most important thing is letting your kid know that you still love and care about them no matter what. 
            This statistically will help their mental health, as unsupportive families are detrimental to lgbt youth.
        </li>
        <li>
            As well as educating yourself and family on how to be a good ally and best support your kid.
            When educating yourself, use educational lgbt sources, 
            as some sources for information are misleading and false which can be harmful to the lgbt.<br>
