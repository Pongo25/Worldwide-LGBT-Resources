<h3>Tips and tricks</h3>

<p>
    Always ask if your doctor can do a payment plan (small payments over time), <br>
    sliding scale payment (free and goes up in price on a scale) or if they do any pro-bono work (free).
</p>

<p>
    You can also see if there is a nearby College with students who need practice, example: <br>
    A nearby dental school does free and reduced price dental cleanings for nearby residents.
</p>

<p>
    Some employers offer health insurance in the US, that price comes out of part of your paycheck.<br>
    The jobs that offer healthcare are either full time jobs at a minimum wage position, or jobs that are salary positions. <br>
    The employer chooses the insurance provider, and they sign you up as part of their plan. <br>
    You can also add a partner or children under your health insurance plan.

<h4>How to ask for accommodations at work</h4>

<p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Check local laws for disability and worker rights
        </li>
        <li>
            After you get your job and are hired(not during an interview), see HR (human resources), or manager if that's not available.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring them your request and doctors note stating your need, and explain. You don't need to expose your medical history, just explain how your employer can help you.
        </li>
        <li>
            Anyone can get medical accommodations, not just disabled individuals.<br>
            Example: One weekend you break your foot and land in crutches, you now need a chair to sit in during shift.<br>
            Example2: You have a lot of doctors appointments coming up and need some time off, you show them doctors note and they allow you extra time off. <br>
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
<p>
    <i>*if you are completely unable to work, ask your local government for information about unemployment and disability income options,etc.</i> <br>

<h3>Job interviews</h3>

<h4>What to say</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
        be polite and collected,smiling and laughing will help your case. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Mentioning that you love XYZ about their company shows them you've read about them, or are already familiar with how they work.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>What to wear</h4>

<p>
    Wear something business casual. No need for a tie or heels, but dont showup in sweat pants or something dirty. <br>
    Wearing a nice, well fitted and clean outfit shows that you will also show up to work ready in uniform each day. <br>
    You want to appear professional and put together.
</p>
<p>
    <i> 
        * If you don't have an interview outfit, consider borrowing a shirt from a friend, going to a thrift store, or asking a local charity for job interview clothes. <br>
        Many charities are more than willing to help someone unemployed with this. Also some even help with job uniform cost. <br>
    </i>
</p>
<h4>Tips</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        Some questions are illegal for an interviewer to ask you. <br>
        They shouldn't ask about your race,religion,sexuality or gender identity. Only things relating to the job.<br>
        See what is allowed: <br>

        </a>
    </li>
    <li>
        Remember you are also interviewing the company too! <br>
        Deciding if this job is also the right fit for you, your schedule and needs. 
    </li>
    <li>
        Calling/emailing the company a few days after applying to check on the application shows that you are excited about that job position (even if you aren't-fake it)
    </li>
    <li>
        Showing up early to the interview shows them that you are responsible and will show up to work on time.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>College financial aid options (US)</h3>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            In the US we use FAFSA or the government’s financial aid program for helping with college via loans (you pay back). <br>
            Even if you or your family have jobs and are well off, you still might qualify for some amount of financial aid. <br>
            Those who have no family help, are homeless,disabled, or were a foster kid might be eligible for more financial aid then others. <br>
