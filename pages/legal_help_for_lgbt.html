    <b>Name change/Gender Marker in US:</b> 
</p>
<p>
    How to change name legally in US step by step:<br>
    In my state I had to file paperwork for court, fill out a form to post a name change in the newspaper before court date 
    (pay fees for both of about $300usd total) 
</p>
<p>
    Then once approved in court I had to change my ID first at the DMV and pay $25usd, <br>
    then go to social security(fee) and then get my birth certificate changed(fee). <br>
    Ask your local DMV what order it should be done in for best results.
</p>
<p>
    For gender marker change I had to go see a therapist 
    or doctor to write me a letter stating that im transgender and now go by Male (or female if you are) medically. <br>
    Then I had to bring that letter in to my local DMV and get them to print out a new card again, same fee. <br>
    Then everywhere else that I was legally that gender like birth certificate,social security card,etc. <br>
    All my medical providers have me listed male, with a note stating im transgender ftm. <br>
    However new doctors only see the word “male” and medically I need to out myself for safety as I have different body organs.
