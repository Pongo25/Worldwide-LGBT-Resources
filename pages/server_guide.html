<h4> Human Trafficking </h4>
<p>
    If you think you may know information about someone being trafficked, please report it immediately at: <a href="https://humantraffickinghotline.org"> https://humantraffickinghotline.org</a> or 1-888-373-7888 <br>
    To learn more about the signs of human and labor trafficking, visit the Polaris Project. <br>
    For more than a decade, Polaris has assisted thousands of victims and survivors through the U.S. National Human Trafficking Hotline,<br>
    helped ensure countless traffickers were held accountable and built the largest known U.S. data set on actual trafficking experiences. <br>
    With the guidance of survivors, Polaris uses that data to improve the way trafficking is identified, how victims and survivors are assisted,<br>
    and how communities, businesses and governments can prevent human trafficking by transforming the underlying inequities and oppressions that make it possible.<br>

<h4>Grounding DBT technique my therapist gave me, "54321"</h4> 

<p>
    This helps me with anxiety and other times I'm overwhelmed.<br>
    Using your senses helps ground you in reality, it also helps distract you from what you might be worried about, <br>
    I know it's helped me alot. 
</p>

<h4>Anxiety breathing techniques </h4>

<p>
    Breathe in, hold, breathe out: <a href="https://tenor.com/view/anxiety-panic-attack-gif-15269229">https://tenor.com/view/anxiety-panic-attack-gif-15269229</a><br>
    Breathe in, image to focus on: <a href="https://tenor.com/view/anxiety-gif-25537730">https://tenor.com/view/anxiety-gif-25537730</a><br>
    This is a breathing technique that is helpful for anxiety. <br>
    Sometimes something as simple as focusing on breathing can help. I know it sounds silly at first, give it a try.
</p>

<h4>Try journaling</h4>
<p>
    Try journaling your thoughts to get them out of your head and onto paper (:<br>
    Maslow’s hierarchy of needs shows us that in order to have good mental health, <br>
    we need our basic needs at the bottom of the pyramid met first.<br>
    (ex: getting safe housing improves mental health) <br>

<b>Socially transitioning:<b>

<p>
    Are you struggling with the concept that you might be transgender?
    It's ok,I was there once too!
    While I had some idea at age 8, some people have no idea until they are an adult: <br>
    like 50-80 year old adult. Everyone’s journey is valid. 
</p>
<p>
    Here are two videos that might be helpful in guiding your self reflection, and only YOU know if you are transgender. <br>
    Nobody can tell you who you are. <br>
    I do recommend getting an lgbt friendly therapist, as that can help you navigate this too. <br>
    (look for the doctor/therapist section in this googledoc)

<b>Passing:</b>
<p>
    Passing means to be perceived as your gender identity and not your sex assigned at birth. <br>
    You can't tell someone is transgender just by looking at them. <br>
    Passing as cis-gender (not trans) might help people feel more comfortable and safe, and relieve dysphoria.<br>
    It's not necessary to pass, but it is some trans folks’ goal during transition.

    How to find health insurance:<br>
    US-Low income options include: Medicaid by state, Medicare(Disabled/Seniors), Obamacare, Healthcare.gov.<br>
    <br>
    Worldwide: Canada, Australia as well as many other countries have universal healthcare programs.
</p>

<p>
    Tips and tricks: always ask if your doctor can do a payment plan (small payments over time), <br>
    sliding scale payment (free and goes up in price on a scale) or if they do any pro-bono work (free).
</p>

<p>
    You can also see if there is a nearby College with students who need practice, example: <br>
    A nearby dental school does free and reduced price dental cleanings for nearby residents.
</p>

<p>
    Some employers offer health insurance in the US, that price comes out of part of your paycheck.<br>
    The jobs that offer healthcare are either full time jobs at a minimum wage position, or jobs that are salary positions. <br>
    The employer chooses the insurance provider, and they sign you up as part of their plan. <br>
    You can also add a partner or children under your health insurance plan.

<p>
    How to ask for accommodations at work:<br>
    Check local laws for disability and worker rights<br>
    After you get your job and are hired(not during an interview), see HR (human resources), or manager if that's not available. <br>
    Bring them your request and doctors note stating your need, and explain. You don't need to expose your medical history, just explain how your employer can help you. <br>
    Anyone can get medical accommodations, not just disabled individuals.<br>
    Example: One weekend you break your foot and land in crutches, you now need a chair to sit in during shift.<br>
    Example2: You have a lot of doctors appointments coming up and need some time off, you show them doctors note and they allow you extra time off. <br>
</p>
<p>
    <i>*if you are completely unable to work, ask your local government for information about unemployment and disability income options,etc.</i> <br>

    <b>Job interviews:</b><br>
    <br>
    What to say - 
    <ul>
        <li>
            be polite and collected,smiling and laughing will help your case. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Mentioning that you love XYZ about their company shows them you've read about them, or are already familiar with how they work.
        </li>
    </ul>
    What to wear -<br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Wear something business casual. No need for a tie or heels, but dont showup in sweat pants or something dirty. <br>
            Wearing a nice, well fitted and clean outfit shows that you will also show up to work ready in uniform each day. <br>
            You want to appear professional and put together.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <i> 
        * If you don't have an interview outfit, consider borrowing a shirt from a friend, going to a thrift store, or asking a local charity for job interview clothes. <br>
        Many charities are more than willing to help someone unemployed with this. Also some even help with job uniform cost. <br>
    </i>
    Tips - <br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            - Some questions are illegal for an interviewer to ask you. <br>
            They shouldn't ask about your race,religion,sexuality or gender identity. Only things relating to the job.<br>
            See what is allowed:

            </a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Remember you are also interviewing the company too! <br>
            Deciding if this job is also the right fit for you, your schedule and needs. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Calling/emailing the company a few days after applying to check on the application shows that you are excited about that job position (even if you aren't-fake it)
        </li>
        <li>
            Showing up early to the interview shows them that you are responsible and will show up to work on time.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    <b>College financial aid options:</b><br>
    <ul>
        <li>
            US - In the US we use FAFSA or the government’s financial aid program for helping with college via loans (you pay back). <br>
            Even if you or your family have jobs and are well off, you still might qualify for some amount of financial aid. <br>
            Those who have no family help, are homeless,disabled, or were a foster kid might be eligible for more financial aid then others. <br>

Methods of HRT<br>
*see a doctor or licensed medical professional to start HRT and get regular blood work for your health and safety. Everyone’s body is different and unique, what works for you friend might not work for you. Always follow your doctor's instructions!<br>
<br>
HRT for Trans Masc:<br>
*testosterone doesn't need an estrogen blocker or another med with it.<br>
 (different than fem transition)<br>
Injections of Testosterone 1x a week or 2x a month, at home (subq or intramuscular)<br>
Medication-pills (testosterone)<br>
Patches on skin (testosterone)-if you are allergic to adhesive this might not be for you<br>
“Testo-pellets” (testosterone)-in office procedure with numbing<br>
“Andro-Gel” for testosterone (or gel for estrogen HRT to rub into skin)-risk to spread to other humans and pets in household<br>
Long Term injections 5x a year called “aveed” (testosterone)-ask your doctor about potential risks (mine made me stay 30 mins after shot in case of rare side effect. I was fine)<br>
Topical cream for estrogen (atrophy of genitals,not main source)<br>
<br>
<br>
HRT for Trans Fem:<br>
*You need Estrogen higher than Testosterone and an anti-androgen to block T. Progesterone might be added to treatment later into HRT journey, ask your doctor if this is right for you.<br>
Medication-pills (estrogen,spironolactone,progesterone)<br>
anti-androgen alternatives to Spironolactone are Cyproterone Acetate,Bicalutamide. <br>
Patches on skin(estrogen)if you are allergic to adhesive this might not be for you<br>
Injections of Estrogen 1x a week or 2x a month, at home (subq or intramuscular)<br>
Gel for Estrogen ( HRT to rub into skin)-risk of rubbing off onto other humans or pets in household.<br>
Topical creams of HRT (for atrophy of genitals, not main source)<br>
Spray and internal rings might also be an option for main source or add on to your hrt<br>
<br>
<br>

ask about post op recovery (how long it is, pain levels,medications,other people helping you,hospital stay,etc)<br>
Risk of complications, how often it occurs and if hospital stays are common.<br>

Name change/Gender Marker in US:<br>
<br>
How to change name legally in US step by step:<br>
In my state I had to file paperwork for court, fill out a form to post a name change in the newspaper before court date(pay fees for both of about $300usd total) <br>
<br>
Then once approved in court I had to change my ID first at the DMV and pay $25usd, then go to social security(fee) and then get my birth certificate changed(fee). Ask your local DMV what order it should be done in for best results.<br>
<br>
For gender marker change I had to go see a therapist or doctor to write me a letter stating that im transgender and now go by Male(or female if you are) medically. Then I had to bring that letter in to my local DMV and get them to print out a new card again, same fee. Then everywhere else that I was legally that gender like birth certificate,social security card,etc. All my medical providers have me listed male, with a note stating im transgender ftm. However new doctors only see the word “male” and medically I need to out myself for safety as I have different body organs. <br>

<br>
<br>
Also! Don't forget(name changes) to let your work know for payment (also your bank), and your school for diploma to have your degree in your new name.<br>
 Bring in your name change paperwork from court thats stamped and show them its been legally changed, if they give you issues you can file discrimination claims with any of the legal teams listed above. <br>

Binding<br>
Do I need a binder? Binders help relieve chest dysphoria and may flatten a chest slightly to appear more masculine. <br>
<br>
<br>
How to find the right size for your binder?<br>
Most websites have a size guide for their binders, measured with a sewing measuring tape(flexible) around your ribs, and also around your chest itself. Make sure the binder you wear you are able to breathe and move around still. <br>
Binders brand new come stiff and over time wear down. If you don't want it to shrink, don't put it in the dryer(the heat shrinks it) so hang it to dry instead. If you do want it to, I'd recommend buying a new one instead. Otherwise just be careful with the heat & timing of it. <br>

https://offbinary.com/blogs/articles/trans-tape-the-ultimate-guide<br>
<br>
How to apply Trans tape Tips & Tricks:<br>
<br>
The preparations and tips<br>
<br>
1. Make sure you have oil at home. Vegetable oil, sunflower oil or olive oil. No scented or flavored.<br>
2. Cut the strips. Usually the size taken is three blocks. Trans tape has lines on the back, thin ones and a visibly thicker one. Three of the thicker blocks being a single strip. Cut out four of these. <br>
3. Cut the corners round, just slightly not making them fully round, just not pointed. This makes it less quickly curl up, like bandaids tend to do at the tips. Makes it last longer.<br>
4. Apply the tape. Now, you will get instructions when ordering trans tape, but I really recommend looking up trans tape application tutorials on YouTube and avoiding the one actually done by the transtape company themselves because I've found those are really bad tutorials and show minimal efficiency.<br>
5. When applying, do not lift your arm and don't lean forward. Instead, lean backwards a bit and keep your arm just somewhere in between, just not pulled up or else it will fold the skin when you put your arm down. These wrinkles in the tape are really bad. If you have just a slight one or very small ones it's fine, but if it's visibly more or really big, take it off. It can cause skin damage or worse.<br>
6. When taking it off, use oil. Let it soak for at least 30 min, then take a hot shower or bath and slowly, very slowly peel it off. If it hurts you're going too fast, it doesn't have to hurt. Also the oil helps to rub off the remains of the glue stuff. Use some lotion or skin care afterwards.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The actual application<br>
Don'ts I've learned through experience <br>
<br>
- Don't bend forward<br>
- Don't put your arm up<br>
- Don't let it wrinkle<br>
- Don't apply at the nearest show of bump where it seems to go up, apply it where you feel gives the most movement when you put your hand on it and push it to the side. Use your fingertips of four fingers to test where it would go if you push it, because pushing it is also how it is applied and how it is pushed influences the end result <br>
- Don't use scented oil, you'll smell like it for three days even with showering and bathing. It's terrible <br>
- Don't forget to make nip covers beforehand. Just small square versions the size that just cover it with a bit of toilet paper and balm on it to keep them from drying out under the tape. You'll really not want to skip this<br>
- Don't forget to buy the oil. Check if you have oil before sticking anything onto your body<br>
- Don't follow a single tutorial. Watch multiple tutorials, if possible ones that have your body type or size, including the aftercare ones. Do a lot of tutorial watching beforehand, saves a lot of trouble.<br>
The rest really just comes down to practice, trial and error, and getting a feel for it. It makes binding breathable and it can be a nice break from a binder, but it can be used long term as well. Since it will show a little bit of a bump afterwards, nothing major just the usual human shape of muscle or fat tissue, but if this makes you uncomfortable you can wear a tough material shirt or top underneath a shirt to have a more flat look. It can be really useful or helpful, really depends per person if they like it or not<br>

Raising a transgender kid: More Coming soon.<br>
<br>
1.The most important thing is letting your kid know that you still love and care about them no matter what. This statistically will help their mental health, as unsupportive families are detrimental to lgbt youth.<br>
<br>
2.As well as educating yourself and family on how to be a good ally and best support your kid. When educating yourself, use educational lgbt sources, as some sources for information are misleading and false which can be harmful to the lgbt. <br>
<br>
*see section on social transition. Support groups for families,how to be good ally & use pronouns*<br>
*see section on representation for lgbt books for adults and kids*<br>
<br>
3.Advocating for your kid at school and doctor for fair and supportive treatment. <br>
